# Multi-tenancy

The registry can scope every operation — publish, retrieve, search, lineage,
pagination — to a **tenant**. Tenancy is off by default (V0-compatible): with no
bindings configured and `require_tenant = false`, requests run unscoped, gated
only by visibility.

Resolution is centralized in `tenant_for_request()` and `tenant_for_publish()`
(`crates/acdp-registry-core/src/handlers/context.rs`). Handlers must never
branch on tenant ad hoc — they call these functions.

## Resolution precedence

For reads (`tenant_for_request`):

```
JWT `tenant` claim  >  X-Tenant-Id header  >  None
```

- The JWT `tenant` claim is **authoritative** — it's issuer-signed. It is set
  only for agents bound via `[[auth.tenant_agents]]` (see
  [AUTHENTICATION.md](AUTHENTICATION.md#jwt-claims)).
- `X-Tenant-Id` is a **fallback**, honored only when no authoritative claim
  applies. It is spoofable, so it is never trusted once a bound token is present.
- If a bound token's claim and the header **disagree**, the request is rejected
  (`403 not_authorized`, "tenant assertion mismatch").
- `None` means "no tenant asserted" → the tenant filter is disabled (V0).

For writes (`tenant_for_publish`): publish is producer-authenticated by the
signature over `content_hash`, not a bearer. So a raw `X-Tenant-Id` must **not**
decide the write tenant — the authoritative source is the producer's
`[[auth.tenant_agents]]` binding (or a tenant-bound token claim). Otherwise any
producer could inject a context into an arbitrary tenant's namespace.

## Strict mode (`auth.require_tenant = true`)

On an enforced multi-tenant deployment:

- A request that resolves to **no tenant** is default-denied (`403
  not_authorized`) — serving it would run with the filter off and could surface
  cross-tenant rows.
- An authenticated caller's tenant comes **only** from the JWT `tenant` claim.
  An unbound token (no claim) may **not** assert a tenant via `X-Tenant-Id`.
- Configuring any `[[auth.tenant_agents]]` requires `require_tenant = true`;
  startup validation enforces this so tenancy can't be half-enabled.
- Strict mode itself requires a tenancy-aware storage backend (`sqlite` or
  `postgres`): startup validation refuses `storage.backend = "memory"` when
  **either** `require_tenant = true` or a non-empty `[[auth.tenant_agents]]`
  is configured. See [Backend support](#backend-support).

In lax mode (`require_tenant = false`) an unbound caller's `X-Tenant-Id` is
still honored, preserving V0 behavior.

## The reserved `default` sentinel

`default` is the column value for untenanted rows. It is **rejected** as an
explicitly-asserted tenant from any source — header or token claim. Allowing a
caller to assert `default` would alias the entire untenanted bucket, a
cross-boundary read/write. Untenanted rows remain reachable only through the
*absence* of any tenant assertion (`None`).

## Backend support

Tenancy requires the `sqlite` or `postgres` backend. The `memory` backend is
**not** tenancy-aware, and startup is refused when `storage.backend = "memory"`
is combined with **either** tenancy signal: a non-empty `[[auth.tenant_agents]]`,
or `require_tenant = true`. An untenanted memory registry — neither of those set
— still starts, which is the ephemeral demo case the backend exists for.

`MemoryStore` overrides none of the three tenancy methods below, so it inherits
their untenanted defaults: `set_tenant_of_ctx` is a no-op, and `tenant_of_ctx` /
`tenants_of_ctxs` report `default` for every row. Because `default` is the
reserved sentinel above and cannot be asserted by any caller, no tenant a caller
*can* assert would ever match a row — every tenant-scoped **read** returns zero
rows. (Publishes still succeed; they simply record no tenant, which is what makes
the reads empty.) A warning would therefore have nothing working to preserve on
the read path: the registry would start cleanly and then serve nothing.

Both signals are covered because either one alone is enough to break reads.
`require_tenant = true` with an *empty* `tenant_agents` is a real configuration:
with no agent bindings no registry-issued token ever carries a `tenant` claim, so
on the read path a caller asserts its tenant with the `X-Tenant-Id` header, which
is what this registry's own default-deny message instructs. (Publishes differ:
strict mode deliberately ignores that spoofable header when the producer has no
binding, so a publish is denied outright.) On this backend those reads then fail
the same way as the `tenant_agents` arm — no asserted tenant can match the
`default` each row reports. (The original refusal keyed on `[[auth.tenant_agents]]` alone and
left that arm starting cleanly and serving nothing; closed in #156.)

## How the binding is stored and filtered

The store carries the tenant binding alongside each context:

- `set_tenant_of_ctx` / `tenant_of_ctx` / `tenants_of_ctxs` — write and read the
  binding.
- `list_contexts(tenant)` and `/admin/contexts` filter at the **SQL level**, so
  pagination pages don't short.
- `list_contexts` also carries `anonymous_public_reads`, the same
  RFC-ACDP-0008 §4.5 term `search` uses: for an anonymous caller
  (`requester = None`), `public` rows are listed only when it is `true`.
  This is orthogonal to tenant filtering — the two are ANDed together, so
  an anonymous caller with `anonymous_public_reads = false` sees zero rows
  regardless of tenant, and a non-`None` requester's results are unaffected
  by this flag.
- Search, lineage and `/lineages/{lineage_id}/current` all **post-filter the
  tenant binding** in the handler rather than in SQL, but only `search` paginates,
  so only `search` carries the short-page consequence:
  - `GET /contexts/search` runs a bounded refill loop, capped at
    `SEARCH_REFILL_MAX_PAGES` inner pages (**6** today,
    `handlers/context.rs`). Hitting that cap returns **fewer than `limit`**
    rows while still emitting a non-`None` `next_cursor`, so a short page is
    NOT an end-of-results signal — keep paging until `next_cursor` is absent.
  - `GET /lineages/{lineage_id}` returns the complete lineage in one unpaginated
    array and filters it in the handler. There is no refill loop and no cursor,
    so there is no short page to misread; a fully-foreign lineage comes back as
    an empty array, not a 404.
  - `GET /lineages/{lineage_id}/current` filters the single resolved version and
    returns **404 `no current version`** when it belongs to another tenant —
    deliberately indistinguishable from "no such lineage", so the endpoint does
    not confirm existence across a tenant boundary.

  Visibility (`public`/`private`) is a separate axis, enforced in SQL, and never
  causes short pages.

## Configuration

```toml
[auth]
enabled        = true
require_tenant = true            # strict: deny requests that resolve to no tenant

[[auth.tenant_agents]]
agent_did = "did:web:agents.acme.example:billing-bot"
tenant_id = "acme"

[[auth.tenant_agents]]
agent_did = "did:web:agents.globex.example:ingest"
tenant_id = "globex"
```

A bound agent's tokens carry `"tenant": "acme"`; its publishes write into the
`acme` namespace regardless of any `X-Tenant-Id` header. See
[CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md#authtenant_agents) for the field reference.
