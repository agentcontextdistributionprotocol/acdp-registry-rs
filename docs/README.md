# acdp-registry-rs documentation

Reference documentation for the Agent Context Distribution Protocol (ACDP)
registry. Two axes matter here and they are **not** the same thing:

- **Advertised version** — the `acdp_version` string served at
  `GET /.well-known/acdp.json`. As of REG-3 (RFC-ACDP-0016 §10 anchors
  support), this is unconditionally `"0.5.0"` for every configuration of
  the shipped binary, because anchors handling has no admin-config gate
  and its version claim always wins the capability-ladder max(). It no
  longer tells you which of the sections below are actually active.
- **Functional capabilities** — what the registry actually enables and
  enforces, which still lights up per-section exactly as before: v0.2.0
  trust-hardening (registry receipts, did:key), v0.3.0 (lifecycle events,
  the transparency log, head receipts), and v0.4.0 (witness cosignature
  aggregation) each activate only when their config sections are
  configured. Check `profiles` and the response bodies (not
  `acdp_version`) to see which of these a given deployment actually runs.

Start with the [project README](../README.md) for a quick start; these docs
go deeper.

## Map

| Doc | What it covers |
|-----|----------------|
| [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) | Crate graph, storage trait, publish pipeline, the request lifecycle. |
| [HTTP-API.md](HTTP-API.md) | Every endpoint: inputs, response shapes, status codes, and the error envelope. |
| [AUTHENTICATION.md](AUTHENTICATION.md) | DID challenge-response, JWT claims, HS256 vs EdDSA, token revocation, cross-issuer federation. |
| [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md) | The full config tree — every TOML key, its env-var name, type, and default. |
| [MULTI-TENANCY.md](MULTI-TENANCY.md) | Tenant resolution precedence, strict mode, agent→tenant bindings, the SQL filter. |
| [WEBHOOKS.md](WEBHOOKS.md) | Event payloads, the GitHub-compatible signature scheme, delivery and retry semantics. |
| [RECEIPTS.md](RECEIPTS.md) | ACDP 0.2.0 registry receipts: enabling, serving `/.well-known/did.json`, the key-retention rule, rotation, did:key, the lineage audit. |
| [OPERATIONS.md](OPERATIONS.md) | Deploying, observability, backup/restore, key rotation, federation ops. |
| [ENGINEERING-LOG.md](ENGINEERING-LOG.md) | The narrative record of what changed and why — reasoning, rejected alternatives, evidence. Was the root `CHANGELOG.md` until #220; per-release notes live in `crates/*/CHANGELOG.md`. |

## Where the protocol ends and this registry begins

These docs cover **this service** — its HTTP surface, storage, auth, tenancy,
webhooks, and operations. They deliberately do **not** restate the protocol the
service implements. Anything about the wire format, signing/hashing,
verification, SSRF defenses, or the canonical error-code registry lives in the
`acdp` protocol library docs and the RFC spec — we link out rather than copy:

## Conventions used throughout

- **Authority** — the registry's bare lowercase DNS name (e.g.
  `registry.example.com`). It is both the `ctx_id` minting authority and the
  `did:web` identifier for the registry.
- **`ctx_id`** — a fully-qualified context identifier scoped to an authority.
- **Wire envelope** — every ACDP data/auth endpoint returns
  `application/acdp+json`; errors follow the RFC-ACDP-0007 §5 envelope
  (see [HTTP-API.md](HTTP-API.md#error-envelope)).
- **RFC-ACDP-XXXX** references point at the [protocol spec][spec].

## Spec profiles implemented

The profile names, their status, and their prerequisites are defined
canonically in the spec's [profile registry][spec-profiles] — this section only
records **which** of them this implementation advertises, not what they mean.

`acdp-registry-core` and `acdp-registry-discovery` always; `acdp-registry-receipts`,
`acdp-registry-head-receipts`, `acdp-registry-lifecycle`, and
`acdp-registry-transparency-log` are advertised when their config sections are
enabled. All are served at `GET /.well-known/acdp.json`.
See [HTTP-API.md](HTTP-API.md#get-well-knownacdpjson).
