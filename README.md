Reference **registry** implementation for the
[Agent Context Distribution Protocol](https://github.com/agentcontextdistributionprotocol/agentcontextdistributionprotocol)
v0.1.0 through v0.5.0. Implements the `acdp-registry-core` and
`acdp-registry-discovery` profiles on top of
[`acdp`](https://github.com/agentcontextdistributionprotocol/acdp-rs) —
plus, as the corresponding config sections are enabled: the ACDP 0.2.0
trust-hardening surface (the `acdp-registry-receipts` profile — signed,
atomically-persisted publish receipts, RFC-ACDP-0010 — self-certifying
`did:key` producers, and a self-hosted `/.well-known/did.json`,
see [docs/RECEIPTS.md](docs/RECEIPTS.md)), the 0.3.0 lifecycle,
transparency-log, and head-receipt profiles, and 0.4.0 witness cosignature
aggregation (RFC-ACDP-0015). Version-gated `anchors` acceptance
(RFC-ACDP-0016, Draft) is unconditional — every deployment advertises
`acdp_version >= 0.5.0` and accepts well-formed anchors on every publish,
see [docs/HTTP-API.md](docs/HTTP-API.md).

## What you get

- **RFC-ACDP-0003-conformant publish pipeline** — full DID-resolution +
  signature verification + lineage coherence + atomic commit.
- **Pluggable storage** — Postgres (production), SQLite (dev / CI), and an
  in-memory backend, behind a unified `ExtendedRegistryStore` trait.
- **DID-bound authentication** — challenge / response over Ed25519, short-lived
  JWTs (HS256 or EdDSA with a published JWKS), token revocation, anonymous
  public reads opt-in.
- **Multi-tenancy** — tenant-scoped publish / retrieve / search via a signed JWT
  `tenant` claim, with an optional strict mode.
- **Cross-registry resolution** — foreign `ctx_id`s are resolved against their
  home registry (public-only, SSRF-guarded).
- **Signed receipts & lifecycle** — RFC-ACDP-0010 publish receipts and head
  receipts, plus RFC-ACDP-0013 retract/republish lifecycle events.
- **Transparency log** — RFC-ACDP-0012 append-only Merkle log with signed
  checkpoints, inclusion/consistency proofs, and RFC-ACDP-0015 witness
  cosignature aggregation.
- **HMAC-signed webhooks** — `context.published`, `context.retrieved`,
  `context.retracted`, `context.republished`, `search.executed`.
- **Abuse controls & observability** — per-IP and global `/auth/*` rate
  limiting, and an optional Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint.
- **Playground mode** — a runtime config flag (`[playground] enabled = true`,
  compiled into every build) that skips DID verification for hands-on demos;
  never enable in production. Only its admin routes are compile-gated behind
  the `playground` Cargo feature.

## Quick start

### Local dev (SQLite)

```bash
# `acdp` is pulled from crates.io — no sibling checkout needed.
# Run with default config (SQLite under ./data/registry.db).
cargo run -p acdp-registry-server

# Or with a config file. NOTE: the example is a production-shaped template —
# it sets auth.enabled = true with an empty jwt_secret and
# allow_ephemeral_secret = false, so it will REFUSE to boot without a secret.
# Supply one (the config's own guidance, registry.example.toml:49-51):
ACDP_REGISTRY_CONFIG=config/registry.example.toml \
ACDP_REGISTRY_AUTH__JWT_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 32)" \
    cargo run -p acdp-registry-server

# For a throwaway local run you may instead set
# ACDP_REGISTRY_AUTH__ALLOW_EPHEMERAL_SECRET=true, which mints a random
# process-lifetime key. Tokens do not survive a restart; never use it in
# production.
```

Then:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8443/.well-known/acdp.json
curl http://localhost:8443/healthz
# {"status":"ok","storage":true,"version":"<version>"}
```

`version` identifies the running build. A locally built binary reports the bare
package version; an image built by CI reports `<version>+g<shortsha>`,
which is what actually pins it to a commit. Treat the string as opaque — see
[HTTP-API.md](docs/HTTP-API.md#the-version-field-117).

### Production (Postgres + Docker)

```bash
cd docker
docker compose up --build
```

## Configuration

Configuration is loaded from a TOML file (`ACDP_REGISTRY_CONFIG` env var, or
`config/registry.example.toml`) and overridden by `ACDP_REGISTRY_<SECTION>__<FIELD>`
environment variables (double underscore separates levels). See
[`config/registry.example.toml`](config/registry.example.toml).

Selected fields:

| TOML key                          | Env var                                     | Notes |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------|
| `registry.authority`              | `ACDP_REGISTRY_REGISTRY__AUTHORITY`         | Bare lowercase DNS name; also the `did:web` identifier. |
| `registry.port`                   | `ACDP_REGISTRY_REGISTRY__PORT`              | Default `8443`. |
| `storage.backend`                 | `ACDP_REGISTRY_STORAGE__BACKEND`            | `"postgres"`, `"sqlite"`, or `"memory"`. |
| `storage.postgres_url`            | `ACDP_REGISTRY_STORAGE__POSTGRES_URL`       | Required when `backend = "postgres"`. |
| `auth.jwt_secret`                 | `ACDP_REGISTRY_AUTH__JWT_SECRET`            | Base64-encoded ≥32-byte secret. |
| `webhook.url`                     | `ACDP_REGISTRY_WEBHOOK__URL`                | HMAC-signed POST target. |
| `playground.enabled`              | `ACDP_REGISTRY_PLAYGROUND__ENABLED`         | Skips DID verification — dev only. |

Visibility (`public` / `restricted` / `private`) is enforced server-side per
RFC-ACDP-0008 §4.5; authenticated callers identify themselves via
`Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`. A header the registry does not recognise as a
bearer is treated as **anonymous** rather than refused on these routes — it
never reaches token validation — while `/admin/*` refuses it. See
[Presenting a bearer](docs/AUTHENTICATION.md#presenting-a-bearer).
Full request/response shapes, error envelope, auth flow, config, and ops are
documented under [`docs/`](docs/README.md).

When `auth.enabled = false`, the `/auth/challenge`, `/auth/token`, and
`/auth/token/revoke` routes are not mounted, and any `Authorization` header is ignored — every caller
is treated as anonymous, so the public/restricted/private gate runs against
`None`.

## Production TLS

The server's `[registry.tls]` block can serve HTTPS directly via `rustls`,
but the recommended production topology is to **terminate TLS upstream**
(Nginx, Caddy, an ALB) and let `acdp-registry` listen on plain HTTP behind
it. The example config's `port = 8443` is a hint that HTTPS is expected at
the edge; the binary itself happily serves plain HTTP on any port. Reasons:

- The DID-web SSRF policy in `acdp-rs` requires HTTPS for *outbound*
  resolution; that's separate from how the registry serves inbound
  traffic.
- TLS termination at the load balancer is the standard ops pattern, gives
  you cert rotation without restarting the registry, and decouples
  performance tuning from the protocol implementation.

For the **playground** profile (`--features storage-sqlite,playground`),
inbound HTTPS is convenient for cross-registry demos; set
`registry.tls.enabled = true` and point `cert_path` / `key_path` at a
self-signed cert.

## Running PG integration tests locally

The Postgres-backed integration suite (`tests/pg_integration.rs`) mirrors the
SQLite suite but exercises `PgStore`. It's gated on `ACDP_REGISTRY_TEST_PG_URL`
and skips cleanly when unset, so day-to-day `cargo test` is unaffected.

```bash
docker run --rm -d --name acdp-test-pg -p 5433:5432 \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=acdp -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=acdp -e POSTGRES_DB=acdp_registry \
  postgres:16-alpine

ACDP_REGISTRY_TEST_PG_URL=postgres://acdp:acdp@localhost:5433/acdp_registry \
  cargo test -p acdp-registry-server \
  --no-default-features --features storage-pg \
  --test pg_integration

docker stop acdp-test-pg
```

Tests run serially (`#[serial_test::serial]`) and truncate the registry
tables between cases.

## Build matrix

```bash
cargo build --release                                          # default = SQLite
cargo build --release -p acdp-registry-server                   \
    --no-default-features --features storage-pg                # Postgres only
cargo build --release -p acdp-registry-server                   \
    --no-default-features --features storage-memory            # In-memory
cargo build --release -p acdp-registry-server                   \
    --features storage-sqlite,playground                       # Playground
```

These four are the common ones, not the whole set. The binary's feature space is
**eight** — 4 backend states (`sqlite` | `pg` | `memory` | `none`) x `playground`
on/off — and CI builds all eight on every commit (#200).

Rather than repeat the list here and give it a second place to go stale, the
authoritative index is the comment above the feature steps in the `clippy` job of
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`. It carries the arithmetic that generates the count, so
the list can be checked rather than trusted.

Note this is the *server binary's* feature space, not the workspace's:
`acdp-registry-types` builds without its default `axum` feature and is not yet
covered by CI (#221).
