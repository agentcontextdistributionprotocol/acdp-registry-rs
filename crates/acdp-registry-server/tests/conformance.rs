//! ACDP spec conformance harness.
//!
//! When `ACDP_SPEC_DIR` is set to a checkout of the spec repo, this test
//! discovers the fixture directory (`schemas/conformance`, `fixtures`, or the
//! dir itself), replays every fixture that is a *deterministic, self-contained
//! HTTP exchange*, and asserts status + error code.
//!
//! There are two modes, gated by `ACDP_REQUIRE_CONFORMANCE` (any value —
//! including the empty string — counts as set/enabled; unset is the only way
//! to get default mode):
//!
//!   * **Default mode** (`ACDP_REQUIRE_CONFORMANCE` unset) — every
//!     spec-dependent path degrades to a logged skip when `ACDP_SPEC_DIR` is
//!     unset, points at a nonexistent directory, or resolves to a directory
//!     with no fixture layout the harness recognizes. Running the spec suite
//!     is opt-in so the repo is independently testable without a spec
//!     checkout on disk.
//!   * **Require mode** (`ACDP_REQUIRE_CONFORMANCE` set) — every one of those
//!     same paths panics instead of skipping: `ACDP_SPEC_DIR` unset, set to a
//!     nonexistent path, set to a path with no resolvable fixture directory,
//!     or (in `did_key_golden_vector_accepted_and_gated`) pointing at
//!     fixtures that don't contain `sig-003-did-key-golden.json`. This is
//!     what the dedicated `conformance` CI job runs (see
//!     `.github/workflows/ci.yml`), so a missing or misconfigured spec
//!     checkout is a red run, not a silent green one. There is deliberately **no** sibling-directory fallback —
//!     `ACDP_SPEC_DIR` is the single explicit contract; letting an unset
//!     variable silently resolve to some other spec tree on disk would
//!     defeat the entire point of require-mode and violate this repo's
//!     pinned-spec-worktree rule. See `crates/acdp-registry-server/tests/conformance_gate.rs`
//!     for the companion guard against running require-mode with the
//!     `storage-sqlite` feature off, which would compile this whole file
//!     away and vacuously pass.
//!
//! The spec corpus is heterogeneous: only some families map to a single HTTP
//! request/response the registry can replay through its public API. The rest
//! are deliberately NOT replayed here, and the harness logs a per-family /
//! per-reason manifest so coverage is never silently truncated:
//!
//!   * **Replayed** — negative publish fixtures that fail at schema/validation
//!     (HTTP 400) with an inline body, stateless retrieval fixtures
//!     (e.g. `ret-*` GET of a missing ctx → 404), and (REG-10 Phase 8, widened
//!     Phase 9a/9b) the `vis-*` fixtures whose `setup` + scenario(s) Shape D can
//!     fully pre-seed, sign, and verify end-to-end: `vis-006` (single
//!     exchange, Phase 8's proof fixture), `vis-001` (5 scenarios), and
//!     `vis-004` (4 scenarios) — the last two include a per-scenario
//!     `context_subset_for_test.contributors`, folded into the seed at seed
//!     time (see [`parse_shape_d`]'s fold step doc comment for why that's
//!     faithful to the fixture's "mutate the seeded row" framing) — plus,
//!     as of Phase 9b, `vis-002` (4 scenarios), `vis-005` (4 scenarios), and
//!     `vis-009` (3 scenarios), which exercise two further Shape D
//!     capabilities for the first time against real (not synthetic)
//!     fixtures: a per-scenario router rebuild driven by
//!     `registry_capabilities_subset.anonymous_public_reads`, and ctx_id
//!     substitution reaching QUERY STRINGS in both raw and percent-encoded
//!     form (`vis-005`'s `?derived_from=<ctx_id>`). As of Phase 9c,
//!     `vis-008` (5 scenarios) joins them: `setup.lineages` — two
//!     two-version lineages, seeded through REAL supersede-chained
//!     publishes (never a direct store write) — and a THIRD substitution
//!     table, `fixture_lineage_id → minted_lineage_id`, alongside the
//!     ctx_id and DID tables. `GET /lineages/{lineage_id}` and
//!     `/lineages/{lineage_id}/current` carry two response shapes no
//!     earlier phase needed: a bare JSON array of `FullContext` (asserted
//!     empty, explicitly, for the restricted-lineage-stranger scenario —
//!     not merely inferred from a zero count), and a single `FullContext`
//!     object with singular `ctx_id` + nested `registry_state.status` (the
//!     `/current` shape). `status` (`active`/`superseded`) is never a seed
//!     input — it's computed by the registry from the supersession, and
//!     asserted as such (see [`replay_shape_d`]'s `want_status_by_ctx`
//!     cross-check). Vacuity note: TWO of `vis-008`'s five scenarios are
//!     "vacuum-passable" — their expected response is indistinguishable
//!     from what an unknown, never-seeded `lineage_id` would ALSO produce,
//!     were the `lineage_id` substitution to silently no-op. Scenario 0
//!     expects `{status: 200, body: [], matches_ctx_ids: []}` from
//!     `GET /lineages/{id}`, which is exactly what an unknown lineage
//!     returns too (the store's `lineage()` query yields an empty `Vec`,
//!     never a `NotFound`). Scenario 3 expects `{status: 404,
//!     error_code: "not_found"}` from `GET /lineages/{id}/current`, which
//!     is exactly what an unknown lineage's `/current` also returns (`None`
//!     from the same empty-lineage path, mapped to `NotFound` by the
//!     handler). For these two scenarios, [`assert_substitution_sound`]'s
//!     positive-substitution proof is the SOLE guard against a silently
//!     broken `lineage_id` substitution passing green; see its doc comment
//!     for the full mechanism and the removal-proof that backs this claim.
//!   * **Skipped — requires pre-seeded state** — fixtures whose
//!     `setup`/`preconditions` (top-level or under `input`) need a context
//!     with a specific registry-assigned `ctx_id` the publish API won't
//!     let us mint, PLUS `ret-002`, excluded from
//!     [`parse_seed_lineage_version`] for two independent reasons: its
//!     `setup.lineages` entries carry no `visibility` key at all (unlike
//!     `vis-008`'s) — a REQUIRED key that's absent, not an unrecognized one
//!     that was rejected — and separately, one entry carries an `expires_at`
//!     key, which genuinely IS outside the recognized set. Either reason
//!     alone would keep it unparseable — AND ret-002's first
//!     lineage requires an "abnormal state: every version is superseded"
//!     (the fixture's own words) that is structurally unreachable through
//!     real publishes: publishing v2 always makes v2 (not v1) the active
//!     head. As of Phase 9b, `vis-001`, `vis-002`, `vis-004`, `vis-005`,
//!     `vis-006`, and `vis-009` had escaped this bucket via Shape D; as of
//!     Phase 9c, `vis-008` joins them too (`ret-002` remains). `idem-001`
//!     through `idem-005` land in this same replayer-skip bucket
//!     structurally (their `preconditions` — an existing idempotency
//!     record, not a literal ctx_id — gate them off Shape D, which only
//!     ever dispatches on `setup`) but, as of REG-10 Phase 10, now have
//!     DIRECT fixture-driven coverage instead, same `anc`/`can`/`vis-003`/
//!     `vis-007` precedent:
//!     `idem001_004_publish_idempotency_key_lifecycle_and_restart_durability`
//!     (the full `idem-001` → `idem-002` → `idem-003` → `idem-004`
//!     sequence, sharing one file-backed harness so `idem-001`'s own
//!     `post_publish_invariants[1]` — the idempotency record surviving a
//!     registry restart — can be proven against a genuinely rebuilt
//!     `Router`/`RegistryServer`/`SqliteStore` connection over the same
//!     on-disk file, not merely inferred from the still-alive in-process
//!     harness) and `idem005_no_support_ignores_idempotency_key_header` (a
//!     SEPARATE harness that genuinely does not advertise
//!     `supports_idempotency_key`). `idem-006` (a concurrency-race fixture
//!     the pinned spec itself lists under `tolerated_outcomes`, not
//!     `required_fixtures`/`conditional_fixtures` — RFC-ACDP-0003 §6.2.1
//!     step 4's atomicity bound, non-deterministic by the fixture's own
//!     `implementation_note`) and `idem-007` (conditional on
//!     `acdp_version >= 0.3.0`; this harness advertises `0.1.0`, so the
//!     condition never fires) are NOT owed by this repo's advertised
//!     capabilities and get no coverage here — see the doc comment on
//!     `idem001_004_publish_idempotency_key_lifecycle_and_restart_durability`
//!     for the full not-owed reasoning.
//!   * **Skipped — Shape D: unrecognized scenario/expected key** — `vis-007`
//!     alone, as of Phase 9b: Shape D CAN seed it (its `setup` fully
//!     parses), but scenario 2 carries no `status`/`http_status` at all
//!     (`expected` is `{outcome, rationale}` describing a response the
//!     registry must NEVER emit — there is no status to assert), so
//!     `parse_expected` fails on it and, by Shape D's parse-all-or-nothing
//!     rule (`parse_scenarios_array`'s `Option<Vec<_>>` — a fixture either
//!     fully parses or is left to this skip path, never partially replayed),
//!     the WHOLE fixture stays unparseable here. It gets DIRECT,
//!     non-Shape-D coverage instead — same precedent as `vis-003` — via
//!     `vis007_search_match_restricted_visibility_disposition`.
//!   * **Skipped — profile not advertised** — fixtures whose
//!     `applies_to_profiles` is disjoint from `HARNESS_PROFILES`, e.g.
//!     `lc-*` (`acdp-registry-lifecycle`), `fed-*`
//!     (`acdp-registry-federated`). This is the harness's advertised
//!     profile set, not a statement about what the registry implements.
//!   * **Skipped — non-HTTP** — `can-*`/`sig-*` (canonicalization & signature
//!     vectors; these belong against the `acdp` library, not the HTTP layer),
//!     `caps-*`/`schema-*`/`meta-*` (document-schema validation), `rate-*`
//!     (informative wire-shape pin), and positive/authz publish outcomes that
//!     need valid crypto material the synthetic fixtures don't carry.
//!   * **Skipped — unsubstituted template** — an exchange whose constructed
//!     path still carries a `{...}` placeholder the harness couldn't fill.
//!
//! `extract_shapes` (below) dispatches every fixture through exactly one of
//! four shapes, tried in this order:
//!
//!   * **Shape A** — top-level `request` + `expected`: one self-contained
//!     exchange (`pub-*` negative publishes, most singleton fixtures).
//!   * **Shape D** — `setup` present AND (`scenarios` present OR (`input` +
//!     top-level `expected` present)): a *stateful* fixture that needs
//!     pre-seeded registry state before it can replay at all (REG-10 Phase
//!     8). Dispatched **ahead of Shape B**, deliberately: a `setup`-carrying
//!     fixture's `scenarios[]` (e.g. `vis-001`) also satisfies Shape B's own
//!     predicate (`request` + `expected` per scenario), and Shape B has no
//!     seeding step — if it ran first it would silently replay such a
//!     fixture against an empty store, turning "context doesn't exist yet"
//!     404s into false-negative passes. Shape D seeds `setup.context_published`
//!     / `setup.contexts_published` through the real publish API (substituting
//!     the fixture's unmintable literal `ctx_id`s and any non-`did:web`
//!     `agent_id`s — see [`replay_shape_d`] and its `SeedContext`/`did_map`
//!     handling), mints a per-scenario bearer from `effective_requester_did`
//!     (no `Authorization` header when it's `null`), and rebuilds the router
//!     when a scenario's `registry_capabilities_subset` overrides
//!     `anonymous_public_reads`. As of Phase 9c it ALSO seeds
//!     `setup.lineages` — two-or-more-version lineages, chained through REAL
//!     `supersede_body()` publishes in `version`-ascending order (never a
//!     direct store write) — building a THIRD substitution table,
//!     `fixture_lineage_id → minted_lineage_id`, alongside `ctx_map` and
//!     `did_map`; see `SeedLineage`/`SeedLineageVersion` and
//!     [`replay_shape_d`]'s lineage-seeding pass. A fixture whose seeding
//!     shape or scenario assertions Shape D doesn't yet recognize (`ret-002`'s
//!     `setup.lineages` shape — missing `visibility`, an `expires_at` key,
//!     and an all-superseded lineage no real publish sequence can produce; a
//!     scenario with no `status`/`http_status` at all, as in `vis-007`
//!     scenario 2; …) is deliberately left to
//!     `unseeded_precondition_reason`'s skip path rather than partially
//!     replayed — see [`parse_shape_d`]. Each Shape D fixture gets its own
//!     fresh in-memory store ([`common::SeededHarness`]), never the shared
//!     `app` Shapes A/B/C replay against.
//!   * **Shape B** — `scenarios[]`, each a self-contained `request` +
//!     `expected` (multi-scenario fixtures Shape D doesn't yet claim).
//!   * **Shape C** — retrieval-by-template: `input.endpoint =
//!     "GET /contexts/{ctx_id}"` + `input.ctx_id` (`ret-*`).
//!
//! Shapes A, B, and C are unmodified by Phase 8 — Shape D takes precedence
//! purely by trying its (narrower, `setup`-gated) predicate first.
//!
//! Any replayed exchange whose status or error code mismatches fails the test.
//!
//! ## Coverage ratchet (`KNOWN_FAMILIES` / `EXCUSED`)
//!
//! `KNOWN_FAMILIES` is the honest claim "we have looked at every fixture
//! family the pinned spec declares" — all 29 keys of `registries/
//! profiles.json`'s `fixture_families` object, each with fixtures on disk,
//! each classified by the manifest above as replayed or skipped-with-reason.
//! `all_conformance_fixtures_are_bucketed_into_known_families` is the ratchet
//! itself: a 30th family (new fixture id prefix the spec adds later) fails
//! the build until a human looks at it and adds it here.
//!
//! `EXCUSED` is a strict subset of `KNOWN_FAMILIES` naming the families this
//! repo asserts don't need HTTP-replay coverage at all, each with a prose
//! reason. An excuse is legitimate only when **both** hold:
//!
//!   1. **Spec-grounded** — no fixture in the family appears in
//!      `registries/profiles.json`'s `acdp-registry-core` profile's
//!      `required_fixtures`, nor anywhere in its `conditional_fixtures`
//!      (fixtures required whenever this repo's advertised capabilities
//!      satisfy the entry's condition — e.g. `dk-*` when `did:key` is
//!      advertised, `idem-*` when idempotency-key support is advertised).
//!      If the spec requires the family of the profile this repo
//!      advertises — unconditionally or conditionally — it cannot be
//!      excused, full stop — no amount of "obviously a pure library vector"
//!      overrides this.
//!   2. **Structural** — every fixture in the family is either a pure golden
//!      vector over a library the server delegates to (no top-level
//!      `request`, no `scenarios`, no `input.endpoint`), or declares
//!      `applies_to_profiles` disjoint from `acdp-registry-core`.
//!
//! `no_excused_family_is_required_by_our_profile` mechanically enforces rule
//! 1 by reading the spec's own `required_fixtures` AND `conditional_fixtures`
//! and rejecting any excuse that contradicts either — this is what gives
//! `EXCUSED` real teeth (unlike `acdp-rs`'s equivalent list, which is
//! unenforced prose).
//!
//! When the ratchet trips, a contributor has exactly two options: add
//! dedicated test coverage for the new family, or add a spec-grounded excuse
//! to `EXCUSED` — and the latter is mechanically rejected if the spec
//! requires the family of `acdp-registry-core`.
//!
//! `wit-*` remains classified "non-HTTP fixture" by the replay harness
//! above (`extract()`'s fallback) and is not itself `EXCUSED` — RFC-ACDP-0015
//! §8 witness-cosignature verification is a pure library check over a
//! witness DID document and an independently-held checkpoint, not a
//! registry HTTP endpoint. `wit-001` (golden) and `wit-004` (wrong-key
//! rejection) now have DIRECT non-HTTP coverage via
//! `wit004_key_mismatch_cosignature_is_rejected_and_wit001_golden_is_accepted`,
//! which drives `acdp::client::verify_witness_cosignature_value` and
//! `evaluate_witness_quorum` in-process — beside, not instead of, the HTTP
//! replayer's skip manifest below.
//!
//! `anc-*` (RFC-ACDP-0016 anchors) is likewise a family the generic replayer
//! cannot reach at any pin: `anc-001` expects a positive (2xx) publish
//! outcome with a placeholder, non-recomputable signature -- `extract_shapes`'s
//! Shape A refuses any non-400 publish outcome by design -- and `anc-002`/
//! `anc-003` carry only an `input.anchor_under_test` fragment, no full body.
//! `anc-001`/`anc-002`/`anc-003` (the three registry-surface members of the
//! family -- anchors schema acceptance at publish time) now have DIRECT
//! fixture-driven coverage via `anc001_well_formed_anchor_is_accepted_and_round_trips`,
//! `anc002_malformed_anchor_content_hash_is_rejected`, and
//! `anc003_empty_anchors_array_is_rejected_with_established_ordering`, which
//! splice each fixture's own anchor data into a freshly-signed body and
//! publish it in-process -- beside, not instead of, the HTTP replayer's skip
//! manifest below, which still (correctly) shows `anc` as non-HTTP-replayed.
//! `anc-004` (a pure hash-computation golden vector over `acdp-crypto`'s
//! JCS/hash pipeline, which this repo delegates to) and `anc-005` (consumer-
//! side scheme-unaware-verifier tolerance -- a registry has no verifier role)
//! are deliberately out of scope; see the doc-comments on the three tests
//! above and the CHANGELOG for the full reasoning.
//!
//! `can-*` (RFC-ACDP-0001 canonicalization & hashing vectors) is likewise
//! not HTTP-replayable -- the family carries no request/response shape at
//! all, just JCS canonicalization/hash golden vectors (`can-*.json`'s
//! `vectors[]`) and, for `can-007` alone, a registry-clock-truncation
//! table with no `input`/hash at all. REG-10 Phase 7 gives it DIRECT
//! fixture-driven coverage, same precedent as `anc`/`wit` above:
//! `can_vectors_reproduce_canonical_form_and_hash` drives `acdp::crypto`'s
//! public JCS surface (`canonicalize_value`, `canonical_preimage`,
//! `derive_lineage_id`) against 30 of the family's 35 vectors, and
//! `can007_registry_created_at_millisecond_truncation` drives this repo's
//! own `acdp::time::trunc_ms` -- the function `acdp-registry-sqlite`/
//! `acdp-registry-pg` actually call when minting `created_at` -- against
//! the remaining 5. As with `anc-004` above, most of `can`'s vectors
//! re-test `acdp-crypto`'s own golden vectors rather than this repo's
//! code; `can_vectors_reproduce_canonical_form_and_hash`'s own doc comment
//! records the counter-argument (the coverage ratchet makes `can`
//! mechanically inexcusable, and the conformance claim is about the
//! binary as shipped, not about which crate owns the tested code). `can`'s
//! *classification* here is unchanged -- it was never `EXCUSED` and still
//! isn't (all 12 ids sit in `acdp-registry-core`'s `required_fixtures`,
//! see `KNOWN_FAMILIES`'s doc comment) -- only its *coverage* changed.
//!
//! `vis-003` (RFC-ACDP-0005 §2.2 search response field-naming) is likewise
//! not reachable through the generic replay loop -- it carries no `setup`
//! (only `background`), and its `scenarios[]` use `input.endpoint` /
//! `input.received_response`, not `request.method`/`request.path`, so it
//! matches neither Shape D (no `setup`) nor Shape B (no `request` at all;
//! it falls through Shape B's own scenario loop to
//! `"scenarios carried no replayable request"`, the family's manifest
//! classification here). REG-10 Phase 9a gives its one registry-side
//! scenario (index 0: registry MUST emit `matches`, MUST NOT emit
//! `results`) DIRECT coverage via
//! `vis003_search_response_emits_matches_not_results`, which drives a real
//! `GET /contexts/search` and asserts on the real response body -- beside,
//! not instead of, the replay manifest above, same precedent as `anc`/`wit`/
//! `can`. Its other two scenarios (indices 1-2) are consumer-side
//! obligations (`expected.consumer_behavior` /
//! `expected.minimum_diagnostic_content`) a registry implementation cannot
//! satisfy or violate by construction -- they describe how a CONSUMER of
//! this registry's response must behave, not this registry's own behavior --
//! and are recorded not-applicable, with this reasoning, in that same test's
//! doc comment rather than silently dropped.
//!
//! ## Coverage completeness ratchet (`COVERED` / `DEFERRED`, REG-10 Phase 11)
//!
//! The four tests above (`all_conformance_fixtures_are_bucketed_into_known_families`,
//! `known_families_are_declared_by_the_spec`, `excused_families_are_known_and_present`,
//! `no_excused_family_is_required_by_our_profile`) fail on an *unclassified* family or an
//! *illegitimate excuse* -- never on a *classified-but-uncovered* one. A family with a
//! logged skip reason and no coverage at all passes all four, which is exactly how `vis`
//! and `idem` sat uncovered before Phases 8-10, and how `lc` still does (#115).
//! (`caps` and `lin` closed to COVERED in Phase 7; only `lc` remains under #115.)
//! Phase 11 closes that gap with a fifth, deliberately UNCONDITIONAL test,
//! `known_families_partition_into_covered_excused_or_deferred`: every family in
//! `KNOWN_FAMILIES` must appear in exactly one of `COVERED`, `EXCUSED`, or `DEFERRED`.
//! "Uncovered" stops being a silent default and becomes something a contributor must
//! declare.
//!
//! Unlike the four tests above (gated on `bucketed_fixtures()`, which skips when
//! `ACDP_SPEC_DIR` is unreachable), this fifth test and
//! `covered_direct_families_have_present_test_functions` (below) touch no spec data at
//! all -- they compare in-file consts against each other and against this file's own
//! embedded source. The required `tests` CI job runs `cargo test --workspace` with no
//! `ACDP_SPEC_DIR` set, so every spec-gated test above skips there; leaving these two
//! ungated is what makes them actually block a merge instead of only advising the
//! separate, non-required `conformance` job.
//!
//! **`COVERED` models two legitimate coverage mechanisms, not one.** The plan driving
//! this phase originally preferred deriving `COVERED` purely from replayed-exchange
//! counts ("every `COVERED` family produced >= 1 replayed exchange"). That is
//! demonstrably wrong: `anc`, `can`, `idem`, and `wit` are genuinely covered by direct,
//! in-process test functions and produce **zero** replayed exchanges -- they sit in the
//! generic replayer's own skip manifest above. A purely-replay-derived `COVERED` would
//! brand all four uncovered, including `can` (Phase 7) and `idem` (Phase 10), the very
//! families this plan added. So `COVERED` is `&[(&str, &[CoverageMechanism])]`, and a
//! family may claim `CoverageMechanism::Replayed`, one or more named
//! `CoverageMechanism::Direct(&[fn_name, ...])` entries, or both (`vis` claims both: it
//! clears `MIN_REPLAYED_EXCHANGES` via Shape A/B/C/D AND carries 10 dedicated
//! `visNNN_*`/Shape-D-driving test functions for scenarios the generic loop can't reach).
//!
//! Both mechanisms are DERIVED, not merely hand-asserted, but by two different oracles:
//! `Replayed` is checked against `replays_spec_fixtures_when_present`'s own per-family
//! `ran` tally -- a real count of exchanges that actually ran and passed in this test
//! run -- so it needs the spec and lives in the `conformance` job. `Direct` is checked by
//! `covered_direct_families_have_present_test_functions` scanning this file's own
//! compiled-in source (`include_str!`) for each named function, confirming it still
//! exists with a test attribute directly above it. Be honest about what that check CAN
//! and CANNOT detect: it is an EXISTENCE check, not a correctness check. It proves a
//! named test has not been deleted or silently de-registered (attribute stripped,
//! renamed away from `COVERED`'s literal string) -- exactly the mutation this phase must
//! catch -- but it cannot prove the test's assertions still say anything meaningful; a
//! gutted `assert!(true)` body would still read as "present," and so would `#[ignore]`
//! written above `#[test]` (the reverse, idiomatic order is caught) or the whole function
//! wrapped in a `/* ... */` block comment. A const naming test functions and re-deriving
//! "present + still a test" from source is the best a self-contained, spec-independent
//! check can do; genuinely re-executing every direct test's assertions as part of this
//! ratchet would just be running the suite, not ratcheting it.
//!
//! `DEFERRED` is `&[(&str, &str, u32)]` -- family, a non-empty written reason, and an
//! open GitHub issue number. `lc` cites **#115** (filed for `caps`/`lin`/`lc`; the
//! first two closed to COVERED in Phase 7, so `lc` is the only one left under it);
//! the remaining 12 cite **#130**, filed enumerating each with its own reason (`meta`
//! and `data-ref` closed to COVERED in Phase 10, `schema` closed to COVERED in Phase 12,
//! same #130 filing).
//! `known_families_partition_into_covered_excused_or_deferred` checks both: reason
//! non-empty, issue is one of the two known-open numbers, and that any of the
//! `caps`/`lin`/`lc` trio still present in `DEFERRED` cites #115.
//!
//! **Required-checks decision (recorded here, not executed):** `conformance (spec
//! fixtures)` is currently NOT among this repo's required status-check contexts
//! (verified directly against branch protection: `rustfmt`, `clippy`, `tests` only).
//! With the coverage story now split across a spec-dependent half (`Replayed`, the
//! `conformance` job) and a spec-independent half (`Direct` and the set-equality ratchet
//! itself, the `tests` job), leaving `conformance` advisory means only the WEAKER half of
//! this ratchet -- the part expressible without executing HTTP replay -- ever blocks a
//! merge; a regression that silently drops a fixture's replayed exchanges (while its
//! `COVERED` entry and direct tests stay intact) would go unnoticed by required checks.
//! The decision, per this phase's own acceptance criteria: `conformance (spec fixtures)`
//! SHOULD join the required contexts. This is a repo-admin action (branch protection
//! settings), deliberately left undone by this change -- see `CHANGELOG.md` and
//! `ASSUMPTIONS.md` for the follow-up recorded for a human to action.

///     no-ops (leaving the fixture's literal, never-seeded id in the
///     built path) produces the EXACT SAME `200 + []` this scenario expects
///     from a correctly-substituted, correctly-filtered request.
///   * **Scenario 3** (`GET /lineages/{id}/current`, stranger, lineage b)
///     expects `{status: 404, error_code: "not_found"}` because the true
///     head is `private`. An UNKNOWN lineage's `/current` ALSO 404s with
///     `not_found`: `acdp-server`'s `RegistryServer::current` returns
///     `None` when `self.store.lineage(lineage_id)` comes back empty (same

///     `lineage_id` substitution here produces the same `404 not_found` a
///     correct, visibility-driven 404 would.
///

// Sibling note to Shape A's non-400-publish refusal below (the "A publish
// fixture is only deterministically replayable to a *schema/validation*
// (400) outcome" comment, just inside the `is_publish` branch): that
// refusal applies only to fixtures replayed as an HTTP *exchange* through
// `extract_shapes`'s own generic path. Shape D's seeding step
// ([`replay_shape_d`]) never goes through `extract_shapes` at all -- it
// calls `common::publish` directly with a request THIS harness signs
// itself (title/visibility/audience lifted from `setup.context_published`
// / `.contexts_published`, everything else supplied fresh), the same
// technique the `anc-*`/`wit-*` direct-coverage tests already use
// elsewhere in this file. A seeded publish is therefore expected to
// succeed (200), not merely tolerated as a 400 — and per the Phase 8 plan,
// a seed publish that does NOT return 200 is a hard bug in the harness's
// own request construction, so `replay_shape_d` panics on it rather than
// skipping or recording it as a fixture mismatch.

// ─── REG-10 Phase 10 (plans/reg10-conformance-and-ci-hygiene.md): idem-001
// through idem-005 direct, fixture-driven coverage ───
//
// **Shape E vs. direct tests -- decision.** `idem-001` through `idem-005` do
// NOT fit Shape D: their top-level key is `preconditions` (an existing
// idempotency RECORD -- `(agent_id, idempotency_key, content_hash)` --
// never a literal, unmintable `ctx_id`), not `setup`, and `idem-005`'s
// `input` is a bare two-element ARRAY of publish descriptors, not a
// `scenarios[]` array of `{request, expected}` pairs. None of Shape D's
// actual machinery -- `SeedContext`/`SeedLineage` parsing, the ctx_id/DID/
// lineage_id substitution tables, per-scenario bearer minting, or the
// scenario-level `registry_capabilities_subset` router rebuild -- has
// anything to seed here: the object under test on every one of these five
// fixtures IS the publish response itself, not a read against a
// pre-existing row Shape D would have to seed first. Bolting a narrow
// "Shape E" onto `extract_shapes` for a five-fixture family whose real work
// is a strictly ORDERED, mutually dependent sequence of publishes
// (`idem-002`/`003`/`004` all replay against the record `idem-001` itself
// creates) would buy nothing Shape D already has and would cost the flat,
// single-exchange replay contract every other shape keeps. So, same
// precedent as `anc-*`/`can-*`/`vis-003`/`vis-007` above: DIRECT,
// fixture-driven coverage below, run BESIDE the generic replayer, not
// instead of it -- the replayer's own skip manifest (module doc-block,
// "Skipped -- requires pre-seeded state") still (correctly) shows
// `idem-001`..`idem-005` as unreached by `extract_shapes`, because direct
// coverage bypasses shape-dispatch entirely. `MIN_REPLAYED_EXCHANGES` is
// UNCHANGED by this phase for the same reason `anc`/`can`/`vis-003`/
// `vis-007`'s direct tests never moved it: none of these five exchanges
// pushes through `replayed`.
//
// **Deviation, following the `anc-001` precedent verbatim (see
// `anc001_well_formed_anchor_is_accepted_and_round_trips`'s own doc comment
// above; also `CHANGELOG.md`).** This repo's `POST /contexts` returns HTTP
// **200** on a successful publish
// (`crates/acdp-registry-core/src/handlers/context.rs:635`,
// `Ok(Json(response))`), never the fixtures' own literal `201`. Every
// status this section asserts is the CORRECTED value (200/200/409/200/200
// for `idem-001`..`005`), not the fixture literal -- each test below also
// asserts the fixture's OWN literal separately, as a sanity check that the
// deviation is real and not invented. Relatedly, `idem-001`'s
// `expected.headers.Location` has NO counterpart to assert: this repo never
// sets a `Location` header anywhere (grepped `crates/acdp-registry-core/
// src/` -- zero hits), so it is a second, silent deviation from the
// fixture and is likewise NOT asserted, NOT synthesized, and NOT "fixed" --
// both deviations are recorded here, in prose, as the `anc-001` precedent
// requires, rather than either faked or fixed (a wire-contract change this
// plan forbids).
//
// **idem-006 / idem-007 -- not owed, with their real reasons (per the
// pinned spec's own `registries/profiles.json`, `acdp-registry-core`
// profile).** `idem-006` sits in `tolerated_outcomes` (`profiles.json:140`
// at pin `417211f`), a THIRD obligation category alongside
// `required_fixtures` and `conditional_fixtures` -- its own notes call it a
// fixture that "documents a tolerated race outcome and is not a strict
// requirement". It pins RFC-ACDP-0003 §6.2.1 step 4's atomicity BOUND under
// concurrent same-key-same-hash publishes, and its own `implementation_note`
// says black-box testing of the race is non-deterministic and wants "a
// stress harness that submits N>=100 paired publishes" -- a dedicated
// concurrency-stress instrument, not a single deterministic HTTP exchange
// this file's harness can produce. Tolerated, not required or conditional:
// NOT owed, and deliberately out of scope for this phase. `idem-007` is in
// `conditional_fixtures`, gated on `acdp_version >= 0.3.0`
// (`profiles.json:128`); this harness's `caps()` (`:327` above) advertises
// `"0.1.0"`, so the condition never fires and the fixture is NOT owed
// either. (Separately, even if it WERE owed: `idem-007` pins a CONSUMER-side
// cross-field check over a capabilities document -- "a 0.3.0 document with
// supports_idempotency_key absent/false is self-contradictory; consumers
// MUST reject it" -- not a registry HTTP endpoint. This registry doesn't
// reject its own capabilities document at serve time; a downstream consumer
// library enforces this when deciding whether to trust a FETCHED document,
// which is out of this repo's remit regardless of the version gate.)

// outcome by design, for exactly that reason — and anc-002/anc-003 carry
// only an `input.anchor_under_test` fragment, no full body. So, following
// the same precedent as
// `wit004_key_mismatch_cosignature_is_rejected_and_wit001_golden_is_accepted`
// and `did_key_golden_vector_accepted_and_gated` above, these three tests
// consume the fixtures' own data directly and drive the registry in-process
// instead of going through the generic replayer. They run BESIDE the
// replayer, not instead of it — the skip manifest in
// `replays_spec_fixtures_when_present` still (correctly) shows `anc` as
// non-HTTP-replayed, because the replayer itself still doesn't replay any
// anc-* fixture.
//
// anc-004 and anc-005 are deliberately OUT OF SCOPE for this phase (see the
// CHANGELOG entry for the same reasoning):
//   * anc-004 is a pure hash-computation golden vector (top-level `vectors`,
//     no `expected.http_status`, no endpoint, no request) over
//     `acdp-crypto`'s JCS/hash pipeline, which this repo delegates to via
//     the `acdp` dependency and does not own. `anchors_round_trip_byte_exact_sqlite`
//     / `pg_anchors_round_trip_byte_exact` (REG-3 Phase 5,
//     `http_integration.rs` / `pg_integration.rs`) already prove that
//     pipeline handles anchors correctly *through this repo's own
//     storage*, which is the part this repo is accountable for. Duplicating
//     anc-004 here would just re-test an upstream crate's own golden vector.
//   * anc-005 is consumer-side behavioral (a scheme-unaware verifier
//     tolerating an unknown scheme) — this registry has no verifier role,
//     and the pinned spec places all five anc-* fixtures in
//     `acdp-consumer`'s `required_fixtures`, never in any

// canonicalization & hashing vector coverage ───
//
// None of the 12 can-* fixtures is HTTP-replayable (no request/response
// shape at all -- see the module doc-comment's `can-*` paragraph), yet all
// 12 ids sit in the pinned spec's `acdp-registry-core.required_fixtures`,
// which makes `can` mechanically inexcusable under `EXCUSED`'s rule 1
// (`no_excused_family_is_required_by_our_profile`, below). So, following
// the same "direct, fixture-driven, in-process" precedent as `anc`/`wit`
// above, the two tests in this section consume every can-* fixture's own
// data directly instead of going through the generic replayer.
//
// TENSION, recorded rather than left implicit (per the phase plan): the
// anc-004/anc-005 paragraph above argues AGAINST re-testing an upstream
// crate's own golden vectors -- "Duplicating anc-004 here would just
// re-test an upstream crate's own golden vector." That objection applies
// just as much to can-001..006/008..012: they are `acdp-crypto`'s own JCS/
// hash golden vectors (`acdp-crypto-0.8.4/src/hash.rs`'s and
// `acdp-jcs-0.8.4/src/lib.rs`'s own `#[cfg(test)]` modules already cover
// several of the same values, e.g. `lineage_id_golden`). The counter,
// which is why this phase exists anyway: unlike anc-004/anc-005 (excused
// on a *spec-grounded* basis -- neither is in any acdp-registry-core
// required/conditional fixture list), all 12 can-* ids ARE required by
// this repo's own advertised profile, so `EXCUSED` mechanically refuses an
// excuse here regardless of how compelling the "pure library vector"
// argument sounds. A conformance claim made about this binary has to cover
// every fixture the binary's own profile requires -- who else in the
// dependency chain already tested the same value is a cost/duplication
// argument, not a coverage argument, and the ratchet is deliberately deaf
// to cost/duplication arguments.

/// `caps`/`lin` before Phase 7, and to `meta`/`data-ref` before Phase 10 --
/// and what still holds for `lc` (#115) and 13 others (#130) today.
/// Every family in this list must now ALSO appear in exactly one of

/// `known_families_partition_into_covered_excused_or_deferred`, which needs
/// no spec checkout and so runs in the required `tests` job. See the module
/// doc-comment's "Coverage completeness ratchet" section for the full
/// design.
///
/// `anc` (RFC-ACDP-0016 anchors) stays classified "non-HTTP fixture" by the
/// generic replay harness (`extract_shapes`'s Shape A refuses `anc-001`'s
/// positive/placeholder-signature publish outcome by design, and
/// `anc-002`/`anc-003` carry no full body) — but `anc-001`/`anc-002`/
/// `anc-003` now have DIRECT fixture-driven coverage (REG-3 Phase 7,
/// `plans/reg3-anchors.md`) via `anc001_well_formed_anchor_is_accepted_and_round_trips`,
/// `anc002_malformed_anchor_content_hash_is_rejected`, and
/// `anc003_empty_anchors_array_is_rejected_with_established_ordering`, same
/// precedent as `wit`. `anc`'s *classification* here is unchanged — it was
/// never `EXCUSED` and still isn't; only its *coverage* changed.
///
/// `can` (RFC-ACDP-0001 canonicalization & hashing) is the same story:
/// still classified "non-HTTP fixture" by the generic replay harness (no
/// can-* fixture carries a request/response shape), but now has DIRECT
/// fixture-driven coverage (REG-10 Phase 7,
/// `plans/reg10-conformance-and-ci-hygiene.md`) via
/// `can_vectors_reproduce_canonical_form_and_hash` (30 of the family's 35
/// vectors, across 11 of its 12 fixtures) and
/// `can007_registry_created_at_millisecond_truncation` (the remaining 5,
/// can-007's registry-clock-truncation table). `can` was never `EXCUSED`
/// either — all 12 of its ids sit in `acdp-registry-core`'s
/// `required_fixtures`, which makes it mechanically inexcusable under rule
/// 1 below — so again only its *coverage* changed, not its classification.
///
/// `vis` (RFC-ACDP-0008 §4.5 visibility scoping) was never `EXCUSED` and
/// never classified "non-HTTP" — it is squarely `acdp-registry-core`'s own
/// business, and REG-10 Phase 8/9a's whole point is widening how much of it
/// this harness can replay for real. As of Phase 9a: `vis-001` (5
/// scenarios) and `vis-004` (4 scenarios) join `vis-006` (Phase 8) as
/// genuinely REPLAYED via Shape D — including, for both, a per-scenario
/// `context_subset_for_test.contributors` folded onto the seed (see
/// [`parse_shape_d`]'s fold step). `vis-003` stays classified
/// "scenarios carried no replayable request" by the generic harness (its
/// scenarios use `input.endpoint`, never `request.method`/`request.path`,
/// so no shape's predicate matches) but now has DIRECT coverage, same
/// `anc`/`can` precedent, via `vis003_search_response_emits_matches_not_results`.
/// As of Phase 9b: `vis-002` (4 scenarios), `vis-005` (4 scenarios), and
/// `vis-009` (3 scenarios) join them as genuinely REPLAYED via Shape D —
/// `matches_ctx_ids` and `total_estimate` are now recognized AND asserted
/// (translated through the ctx_id substitution map at replay time) — with
/// ONE exception: `total_estimate`'s EXACT VALUE is never asserted for a
/// `derived_from`-filtered scenario (`vis-005` scenario 2), a spec-licensed
/// pre-refinement-upper-bound carve-out (`DESIGN-01`, see the comment in
/// `parse_scenarios_array`); leak-invariance is asserted there instead, and
/// `derived_from_carve_out_matches_exactly_one_corpus_scenario` guards the
/// carve-out from silently widening to a second fixture. As of spec
/// b8601e2 (spec issue #41), that exception is no longer merely a
/// registry-side carve-out: the spec's own fixture replaced `vis-005`
/// scenario 2's exact-value `total_estimate: 0` pin with
/// `expected.total_estimate_constraints`, a leak-invariance property this
/// harness now asserts directly (`want_total_estimate_constraints`,
/// [`TotalEstimateConstraints`], checked in [`replay_shape_d`]) — bounds
/// read off the fixture itself, not hardcoded. And
/// two further Shape D capabilities are exercised for the first time
/// against real fixtures rather than only the Phase 8 synthetic proof:
/// per-scenario router rebuild on `registry_capabilities_subset.
/// anonymous_public_reads` (`vis-002` scenarios 2/3, `vis-009`), and
/// substitution reaching query strings in both raw and percent-encoded
/// form (`vis-005` scenario 2's `?derived_from=<ctx_id>`). `vis-007`
/// remains classified "Shape D: unrecognized scenario/expected key" by the
/// generic harness — its scenario 2 (`outcome: registry_must_not_emit_
/// this_response`) carries no `status` at all, so `parse_expected` fails
/// on it and, by Shape D's parse-all-or-nothing rule
/// (`parse_scenarios_array`'s `Option<Vec<_>>`), the WHOLE fixture stays
/// unparseable — but now has DIRECT coverage, same `anc`/`can`/`vis-003`
/// precedent, via `vis007_search_match_restricted_visibility_disposition`
/// (scenarios 0 and 1 replayed and asserted for real; scenario 2 recorded
/// not-assertable, in that test's doc comment, since it has no expected
/// HTTP outcome to replay at all). As of Phase 9c, `vis-008` (5 scenarios,
/// `setup.lineages`) joins the genuinely-REPLAYED set too — the THIRD
/// substitution table this phase adds, `fixture_lineage_id →
/// minted_lineage_id`, seeded through real `supersede_body()`-chained
/// publishes (two two-version lineages, never a direct store write). `ret`
/// stays classified "requires pre-seeded registry state" for `ret-002`
/// alone: its `setup.lineages` entries carry no `visibility` key and one
/// carries `expires_at`, both outside [`parse_seed_lineage_version`]'s
/// recognized set, and its first lineage requires an all-superseded state
/// no real publish sequence can produce (publishing v2 always makes v2,
/// not v1, the active head) — structurally excluded, not by fixture id.
/// Only `vis`'s *coverage* changed here, never its classification.
///
/// `idem` (RFC-ACDP-0003 §6 idempotency keys) was never `EXCUSED` either —
/// `idem-001`..`idem-005` sit in `acdp-registry-core`'s own
/// `conditional_fixtures`, gated on `supports_idempotency_key: true`, which
/// `caps()` (`:327` above) advertises, making them live obligations. The
/// generic replay harness still classifies all five "requires pre-seeded
/// state" (their `preconditions` key — an existing idempotency record —
/// isn't a shape any of A/B/C/D dispatch on), but REG-10 Phase 10 gives
/// them DIRECT fixture-driven coverage, same `anc`/`can`/`vis-003`/
/// `vis-007` precedent:
/// `idem001_004_publish_idempotency_key_lifecycle_and_restart_durability`
/// (the full `idem-001`→`idem-002`→`idem-003`→`idem-004` sequence, one
/// shared file-backed harness, with a genuine store-reconnect proving
/// `idem-001`'s restart invariant) and
/// `idem005_no_support_ignores_idempotency_key_header` (a second harness
/// that genuinely does not advertise the capability). `idem-006` is
