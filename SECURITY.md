# Security Policy

## Supported versions

`acdp-registry-rs` is pre-1.0; only the current release line is supported.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report security issues privately via GitHub's **security advisory**
workflow (`Security` → `Report a vulnerability`) rather than opening a public
issue. We aim to acknowledge reports within 72 hours.

## Hardening guidance

- Always set a real `ACDP_REGISTRY_AUTH__JWT_SECRET` in production (≥32-byte
  base64-encoded random material). With auth enabled and HS256, the startup
  validator refuses to boot on an empty secret — the random process-lifetime
  fallback requires an explicit `auth.allow_ephemeral_secret = true` and is for
  local development only (its tokens do not survive a restart). **On HS256** a
  non-empty secret is checked regardless of `auth.enabled`: it is rejected if
  it is `changeme` (matched case-insensitively after trimming), or if it does
  not decode to ≥32 bytes. So on HS256 a placeholder cannot survive unnoticed
  in an auth-disabled stack — it stops that stack from booting at all. The
  shipped docker compose stack accordingly ships NO secret rather than a
  placeholder: an empty secret with auth disabled is a supported
  configuration, and the unused ephemeral key it generates signs nothing,
  because no token is issued or verified while auth is off.
- **Under EdDSA, `jwt_secret` is never examined at all** — not for the
  `changeme` literal, not for length, with auth on or off. A stale or
  placeholder secret left in config or the environment is therefore silently
  ignored rather than rejected: it neither stops a boot nor warns. Observed,
  not inferred: `auth.enabled = true`, `jwt_signing_alg = "EdDSA"`, a valid
  `jwt_private_key_pem` and `jwt_secret = "changeme"` boots normally. If you
  move a deployment from HS256 to EdDSA — which the next bullet recommends for
  federation — remove `jwt_secret` yourself; nothing will remind you.
- For federated deployments, prefer EdDSA (`auth.jwt_signing_alg = "EdDSA"`) so
  peers verify your tokens against the public key at `/.well-known/jwks.json`
  instead of a shared secret. See [docs/AUTHENTICATION.md](docs/AUTHENTICATION.md).
- Run behind a TLS-terminating proxy. A non-loopback `bind` without TLS or auth
  refuses to start unless `registry.allow_public_bind = true`. Outbound
  cross-registry resolution and webhook delivery require HTTPS — `acdp`'s
  `SsrfPolicy` rejects HTTP and private/internal authorities.
- Keep `auth.anonymous_public_reads = false` unless the registry is meant to
  serve world-readable public contexts; otherwise require a bearer for reads.
  On multi-tenant deployments set `auth.require_tenant = true` so a request that
  resolves to no tenant is denied rather than served unscoped
  (see [docs/MULTI-TENANCY.md](docs/MULTI-TENANCY.md)).
- Set `auth.admin_tokens` to gate `/admin/*`; an empty list disables those
  routes entirely. Distribute admin tokens out of band. Every entry must be
  non-blank and free of surrounding whitespace — startup refuses otherwise
  (#161). This matters because the allowlist compare folds over **every**
  entry, so a single blank entry is admitted alongside real tokens, leaving a
  deployment that looks correctly configured. Reaching it requires
  `Authorization: Bearer ` to keep its trailing space, which happens over
  HTTP/2 but not HTTP/1.1 (where the request parser strips it) — so the
  exposure is protocol-dependent, and the registry serves both. If you template
  this list from environment variables, make sure an unset variable fails your
  deploy rather than producing an empty entry.
- A non-`Bearer` or malformed `Authorization` header is treated as **anonymous**
  on the ordinary read/publish routes, not refused — a typo'd scheme never
  reaches token validation. What the caller then sees depends on the route and
  on `auth.anonymous_public_reads` (default `false`), so it may be a refusal or
  a filtered result set; either way the auth layer did not reject the header.
  `/admin/*` refuses the same input with `403`. See
  [docs/AUTHENTICATION.md](docs/AUTHENTICATION.md) for the exact rules; do not
  rely on a malformed header producing an authentication error.
- Leave the per-agent rate limits (`limits.publish_rate_per_minute`,
  `limits.challenge_rate_per_minute`) enabled; front multi-replica deployments
  with a shared/proxy limiter for a global bound.
- Leave the `[rate_limit]` per-IP + global `/auth/*` limiter enabled (it is on
  by default). Behind a reverse proxy, set `rate_limit.trusted_proxies` to the
  proxy's CIDR so the client IP is read from `X-Forwarded-For` — the header is
  never trusted otherwise, since an unauthenticated client could spoof it to
  dodge the per-IP bucket.
- If you enable the Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint on a network you don't fully
  trust, gate it with `metrics.bearer_token` (or keep it behind the proxy).
- Revoke compromised tokens with `POST /auth/token/revoke` instead of rotating
  the signing key when a full rotation is too disruptive.
- Restrict the Postgres role to the application database — the migrations are
  the source of truth for the schema; do not let the registry user create
  extensions or alter system tables.
- Disable `playground` mode in any environment that touches non-test data. The
  feature exists for hands-on demos; it skips DID verification on publish.
- Pin your container image by digest, not by tag.
