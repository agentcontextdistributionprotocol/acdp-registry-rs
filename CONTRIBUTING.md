# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in `acdp-registry-rs`.

## Setup

1. Install Rust 1.88 or newer (`rustup install stable`).
2. (Optional) Install `cargo-deny` if you plan to touch dependencies.

The protocol library [`acdp`](https://crates.io/crates/acdp) is consumed from
crates.io — no sibling checkout is required.

## Pre-PR check set

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
```

Run the feature-flag variants if you touched the server binary or its callers:

```bash
cargo clippy -p acdp-registry-server --no-default-features --features storage-pg --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo clippy -p acdp-registry-server --features storage-sqlite,playground   --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test   -p acdp-registry-server --features storage-sqlite,playground
cargo clippy -p acdp-registry-server --no-default-features --features storage-memory --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test   -p acdp-registry-server --no-default-features --features storage-memory

# The binary's feature space is eight: 4 backend states (sqlite | pg | memory |
# none) x playground on/off. CI builds all eight (#200); these four are the ones
# the block above omits. Skipping them passes locally and reddens `clippy` on
# the PR, which is a required check.
cargo clippy -p acdp-registry-server --no-default-features --features storage-pg,playground --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo clippy -p acdp-registry-server --no-default-features --features storage-memory,playground --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo clippy -p acdp-registry-server --no-default-features --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo clippy -p acdp-registry-server --no-default-features --features playground --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

The authoritative list is the comment above those steps in
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` — it carries the arithmetic that generates the count,
so you can check the list rather than trust it.

CI additionally gates PRs on checks you can reproduce locally:

```bash
# Postgres-backed tests (skipped silently when the env var is unset).
# Point ACDP_REGISTRY_TEST_PG_URL at a disposable database.
ACDP_REGISTRY_TEST_PG_URL=postgres://acdp:acdp@localhost:5432/acdp_registry \
    cargo test -p acdp-registry-pg
ACDP_REGISTRY_TEST_PG_URL=postgres://acdp:acdp@localhost:5432/acdp_registry \
    cargo test -p acdp-registry-server --no-default-features --features storage-pg --test pg_integration

# MSRV — the workspace must compile on Rust 1.88.
cargo +1.88 check --workspace --all-targets

# rustdoc must build warning-free.
RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --workspace --no-deps

# Dependency audit (runs unconditionally in CI, not optional).
cargo deny check

# Spec conformance — replays HTTP-shaped fixtures from the ACDP spec
# against a live server built from this crate. ACDP_SPEC_DIR must point
# at a checkout of the *whole* spec repo (agentcontextdistributionprotocol/
# agentcontextdistributionprotocol), not just its schemas/conformance
# subdirectory — the harness also reads registries/profiles.json from
# the spec root for the KNOWN_FAMILIES/EXCUSED coverage ratchet; pointed
# at schemas/conformance alone, that ratchet silently skips instead of
# running (same replay count and exit code either way — check the log
# for "skipping" lines, not just the exit code). ACDP_REQUIRE_CONFORMANCE=1
# turns a missing spec into a hard failure instead of a silent skip.
ACDP_REQUIRE_CONFORMANCE=1 ACDP_SPEC_DIR=/path/to/spec/checkout \
    cargo test -p acdp-registry-server --features storage-sqlite,playground \
    --test conformance --test conformance_gate -- --nocapture
```

CI's `conformance` job checks out the spec at a SHA pinned in
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` (the `conformance` job's `ref:`), so a push to the
spec repo cannot silently change this repo's CI result. When adopting new
fixtures, bump that SHA deliberately in its own commit. The bump can be
driven by running the `bump spec` workflow from the Actions tab (optionally
with an explicit SHA), which opens a PR for review rather than committing
directly.

CI also measures coverage with `cargo llvm-cov` (summary on the run page, lcov
artifact attached) and smoke-tests the Docker image on every PR — it builds the
`storage-pg` image, boots it against Postgres, and curls `/healthz`.

### Declaring coverage for a new fixture family

If the pinned spec adds a new fixture-id family (`KNOWN_FAMILIES` in
`crates/acdp-registry-server/tests/conformance.rs` grows to 30), every plain
`cargo test --workspace` run — no spec checkout required — fails at
`known_families_partition_into_covered_excused_or_deferred` until the new
family is classified as exactly one of:

- **`COVERED`** — real coverage exists, via `CoverageMechanism::Replayed`
  (the family produces >= 1 exchange through the generic HTTP replayer),
  `CoverageMechanism::Direct(&[...])` (named in-process test functions), or
  both.
- **`EXCUSED`** — a spec-grounded, structural reason this repo doesn't owe
  HTTP-replay coverage for it (mechanically checked against the spec's
  `required_fixtures`/`conditional_fixtures`; see `EXCUSED`'s doc comment).
- **`DEFERRED`** — not yet covered, with a non-empty written reason and an
  open GitHub issue number tracking it.

"Uncovered with no entry anywhere" is not an option the ratchet allows.

## Commit messages

Conventional Commits are required. The release pipeline derives the changelog
and version bumps from these prefixes:

- `feat:` — new user-visible capability
- `fix:` — bug fix
- `docs:` — documentation only
- `refactor:` — internal refactor with no behavior change
- `test:` — tests only
- `chore:` — tooling / metadata
- `BREAKING CHANGE:` (or `!` suffix) — semver-breaking change

## Adding a new endpoint

See `CLAUDE.md` → "Adding a new endpoint" for the four-step recipe.

## Documentation

Reference docs live in [`docs/`](docs/README.md) (HTTP API, authentication,
configuration, multi-tenancy, webhooks, operations). When a change alters the
HTTP surface, config, auth, or operational behavior, update the relevant page in
the same PR. Document protocol-level concepts by linking to the
[`acdp` library docs](https://github.com/agentcontextdistributionprotocol/acdp-rs/tree/main/docs)
rather than restating them.

## Migrations

- Number new migrations sequentially within `crates/acdp-registry-<backend>/migrations/`.
- Never edit an applied migration; add a new one.
- Each migration must be idempotent (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, `ON CONFLICT
  DO NOTHING`, etc.).
